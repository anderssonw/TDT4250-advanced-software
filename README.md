##Course of Study
In the Studyplan model there is a class called Course of Study. This is defined as "the courses of which an education is formed by". The class is used both for Progamme and Specialization (continuation). You can think of program as a sequence of semesters ending in a set of possible continuations, and the continuations are just like the programme itself, they also contain semesters and end in a set of possible continuations.
